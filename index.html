        <h2 class="home-headline-2">What are some of the most important questions to ask when arriving in another country?</h2>
        <p class="home-paragraph-2" >How Should I Salute People?</p>
        <p class="home-paragraph-2" >Always have a phrase book on hand when entering a new country, that is a good idea in any case, but there is more to a greeting than simply words. Once you say the phrase, there is still the appropriate body language. While air kisses on the sides of the face can be appropriate in places like France and Colombia, in a country as Korea or Japan, a slight bow at the waist is what you'll see commonly exchanged.</p> 
        <p class="home-paragraph-2" >Am I Talking This Right?</p>
        <p class="home-paragraph-2" >When we speak to people while traveling outside of our country, we have a distinct accent that stands out. Because of the natural way we have trained our mouths, we usually pronounce words in a foreign language with our own accents. If you want to see the expression of a local change from annoyed to impress in a split second, try enunciating using the native accent</p> 
        <p class="home-paragraph-2" >Where Can I Find Wi-Fi?</p> 
        <p class="home-paragraph-2" >It is healthy to unplug from the virtual grid. Vacation should be the time to live in the moment, forgetting about the rest of the world. You can look up a historical fact that helps you appreciate a tourism point or communicate with a friend using Google Translate. And the most important, Wi-Fi will help you find your way back to your accommodations if you get lost.</p> 
        <p class="home-paragraph-2" >How Does the Public Transit System Work?</p> 
        <p class="home-paragraph-2" >Without access to a big transit system, it can get overwhelming for a visitor to blindly figure out how properly get around a new place. Where do you buy tickets? How much is the fare? Should you take the bus or train? Mix gestures and the few words you've learned from your phrase book to ask for help. Once you master the first ride, it'll be easy street from then on.</p> 
        <p class="home-paragraph-2" >Is This Rude?</p>  
        <p class="home-paragraph-2" >Not all gestures were created equal. You might have picked up some traits from the place you raised in like putting your hands in your pockets or posing for a picture holding up two fingers as the peace sign. While these mean nothing to another from your place, they could be incredibly offensive elsewhere. In Asia, hands in pockets can signal arrogance, and the peace symbol, if done with the back of your hand showing, can be synonymous with a single middle finger in Ireland or the United Kingdom.</p> 
        <p class="home-paragraph-2" >What Are the Major Regional Religions?</p> 
        <p class="home-paragraph-2" >One of the largest contributions to the culture of every country is its religious background. From the politics down to the food preparation, understanding the religious blueprint of a place will shed light on everyday life there. As a responsible traveler, you wouldn't want to disrespect the majority of just because you didn't know the basic expectations.</p>
